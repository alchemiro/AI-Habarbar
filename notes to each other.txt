is the login a page for it self, or is it a popup? could even be part of the home page

בשביל לעשות אפיון בצורה תקינה אנחנו צריכים לנסח באופן מפורט את הבקשה של הלקוח (אייל) ולאחר מכן להתחיל לפרט על מסכים שיענו לבקשה, עדיפות לציור המסך או המחשה אחרת, כולל פירוט פונצקיות אפשריות על המסך. לאחר כל זה לגשת לאייל לוודא איצו שזה באמת הבקשה, אם לא לשנות, אם כן נתחיל יצירת קוד

Users: students, judges, Eyal
Customer: Eyal

Sections:
Judges - display projects to the judges, allow them to grade (and save the grade), and direct them to the next projects
Students - Allow them to like projects, and allow them to edit their own projects
Admin - complete access, allows you to edit, erase, add new projects, edit grades and edit who the judges are

MAP
code that gets a map, self evaluate places to put project, then we send a doc, each student reserves prefered location - ask eyal
maybe connect to google maps and share location
problems: signal interfirance in close space, students moving wothout control.

another idea, using qr, every scan will update the project
the map start from fixed point with fixed zoom, the admin can edit this \ another option is to make a ode that zoom around the locations auto (harder to do)

make UML of all objects
permission levels:
User - basic (no permissions)
inherit users Judge and Admin
who can like? also grade 13? if yes, student must be split into inherit competitor
ethics of liked projects?
judge can't like, only grade
free like amount

admin has a page to rwu judges
click judge leads to judge's page instead of MyPage
check that judge to project is 1:1 and not 1:M

submission system for projects waiting for admin auth
allow upload and edit, no deletion (unless authorized)

ask eyal how he wants to do the map
tell him that indoor api costs money
use stand no. system

this translates to the following pages:
Judge profile page
competitor project page
Gallery = Home Page
Admin dashboard
My project page
map page
